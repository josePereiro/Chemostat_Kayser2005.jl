# The average crowding coefficient a was fitted to obtain the minimum square 
# deviation between the measured and model predicted growth rates, 
# resulting in a = 0.0040 ± 0.0005 h•g/mmol, in which g is grams dry weight. 
# However, the maximum growth rates on glucose and glycerol are more consistent 
# with a = 0.0031 ± 0.0001 h•g/mmol and a = 0.0053 ± 0.0001 h•g/mmol, respectively.
